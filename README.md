# A LaTeX Template for Formal Papers in Political Science

This template contains my various LaTeX hacks for formal work, accumulated over the past 14 or so years of writing formal papers.
Key features include:

* Restatement of lemmas/propositions/etc alongside their proofs in the Appendix, so readers don't have to flip back to remember what the result was
* Table of contents just for the Appendix so readers can quickly find the proof of the result they care about
* Bibliography just for the Appendix so you don't use up your precious word count on things not cited in the main text
* Results/equations/float environments introduced in the Appendix are numbered with an "A" (e.g., Lemma A.2) so readers can quickly tell what originated where
* [No weird colors or highlighting for links and references](https://twitter.com/keithschnak/status/1565693515207680004?s=20&t=Fy6aHQukUthyPVKqKJ_ZPw)
